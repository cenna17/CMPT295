## Forms of Learning

`Induction` = specific set of observ. -> general rule

`Factored Representation` = a list (vector) of features/values of something

`Regression` = Where the output for the set of inputs is a `number`

`Classification` = Where the output for the set of inputs is a bunch of stuff that can be divided or 'classified'

### Supervised Learning

- Is directed; we give things labels (usually as part of testing set) and try to get the machine to give the correct label for new things/inputs

- We give it feedback (right guess/wrong guess)

### Unsupervised Learning  

- Not directed; we DO NOT give it feedback

- Tasks: clustering (detect clusters of cases that may become usefull)

### Reinforcement Learning

- Learning from reward and punishment
